WorkoutBuddy
============
Introduction:

This is the senior design project about a web application that is called Workout buddy, trying to fix bugs and translate it into a phone application that will look clean and smart.

Workout Buddy:
Web-based workout tracking application built for gyms in general.
The system is intended to record  a member’s check-in and check-out times.
The product can automatically track workout hours.
A request for help function will connect members with fitness staff directly.

Why would we develop such a system?
It will cut down on the amount of manual entry required.
It will allow the staff to access a student's gym records for more personalized help.
It will easily connect the members with the fitness staff.
Any similar systems around?
Yes, Ex: Myfitnesspal (http://www.myfitnesspal.com/).
This is one of many workout tracking applications.
How is our system different from the others?
It is different in the sense that it will implement features like:
Check-in and check-out tracking.
Workout History.
Add Friends / Friend List.

Targeted Users

Who are the target users of your system?	
We are currently focused on general gym users. (Students & Faculty)
How will the target users be benefited by your system?
It will allow them to have the flexibility to create and track their gym progress and workout history easily with the swipe of a card.
It will easily connect users with the fitness staff.
What is the business model?

System Scope

We are trying to create an environment that will allow Drexel students to keep track of their gym workouts fast and efficiently.

The system should allow the user to select:
Pre-created workout schedule or create their own workout schedule for advanced users. 
The ability to request help from the fitness staff.
The ability to share their workout schedules with friends.
Receive notifications about their workouts.

Information Gathering

How do you collect these user requirements?
Through trial and error we phased out what needed to be required and what could be scraped.
Have you interacted with the users to get their feedbacks after developing these use cases?
No, we have yet to put this into production, as a result, everything is still in the testing phase
For future implementation, we will include a survey page to come up on sign out to ask for improvements that can be made to the system.

User Documentation

How users can learn to use your system?  
There will be a how to use, and a FAQ to help the user understand the web app.
There is a description on the homepage.
